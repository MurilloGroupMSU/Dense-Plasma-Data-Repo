# Michigan State Dense Plasma Properties Database

This repo contains various forms of data that characterize the physical properties of dense plasmas. The data sources are from computational results. The current data was obtained from published results, digitized and stored in CSV files.

Each file includes a header that describes its content and source.

This database was initially built by:
* Mathieu Marciante (LANL),
* Liam Stanton (LLNL).
* Michael S. Murillo (MSU),

but many others have since contributed.
