# Dense Plasma Properties Database
</center>

This repo contains various forms of data that characterize the physical properties of dense plasmas. The data source is either computational or experimental. The current data was obtained from published results, digitized and stored in CSV files.

Each file includes a header that describes its content and source.

We are also developing a Jupyter notebook for easy viewing of the database. An example Jupyter notebook is included here, but it is only here as a test; please don't try to use it directly, but use it as motivation for building your own tool.


This database was initially built by:
* Mathieu Marciante (LANL)
* Liam Stanton (LLNL)
* Michael S. Murillo (MSU)
