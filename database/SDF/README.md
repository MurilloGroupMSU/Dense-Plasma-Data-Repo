The dynamic structure factors of Yukawa potential
Calculated using the molecular dynamics via Sarkas.
Yukawa reduced unit is used (time is normalized by the ion plasma frequency, length is normalized by the ion sphere
radius)

Simulation parameter:
dt = 0.01
Number of timesteps = 80000
Number of particles = 10000

plasma parameters:
kappa = 0; Gamma = [10, 50, 150]
kappa = 1; Gamma = [14, 72, 217]
kappa = 2; Gamma = [31, 158, 476]
kappa = 3; Gamma = [100, 503, 1510]


The data contains the DSF for only 0.0 < w < 3. If you need higher frequency data, please contact Prof. Murillo murillom@msu.edu. 

The data is written in Python numpy format.
The data size is (166x763) and covers  0.18< q < 30, and 0 < w < 3.
The 0th row is the frequency
The 0th column is the wavenumber
