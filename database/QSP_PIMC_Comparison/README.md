The attached plot and data compare radial distribution functions for four plasmas ($r_s = 0.1, ...$) using both QSPs and PIMC.

* **QSPs**: The standard Hansen-McDonald diffraction and Pauli potential were used. 
* **PIMC**: The PIMC data is from Brown et al. and can be found [here](https://github.com/etano/3DHEG).
