This folder contains results from HNC-based models, including:
* ionic pair potentials,
* classical-map hypernetting chain (CHNC),
* quantum statistical potentials.

The basic idea of HNC is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernetted-chain_equation), and the CHNC method is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical-map_hypernetted-chain_method).
